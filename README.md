# Digit Recognizer

Kaggle challenge.

## Overview

We tackled the Kaggle challenge ['Digit Recognizer'](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer). It consists of predicting with Machine Learning Regression models numbers that are shown in images.


## Dataset

The dataset was provided by Kaggle and was consisted in 42000 pixelated (28,28) images of hand drawn numbers.

## Main Steps

- Dataset exploration
- Normalizing
- Modeling
- Final testing
- Submiting

## How to run the code

1. Either clone the repository or download the files
2. Install requirements (requirements.txt.txt)
3. Download the dataset from Kaggle
4. Open the notebook: ML-Digit-Recognizer/main.ipynb
5. Run the notebook

## Techniques and tools

- Pandas: Dataset manipulation
- Numpy: Array manipulation
- Scipy, Scikitlearn: Train and test set
- Tensorflow, Keras: Modeling
